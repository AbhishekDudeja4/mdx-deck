## **Drive AI** provides a 3 fold facility for vehicle safety
* `Distance Estimation & Classification` - **Back Camera Object Detection**
* `Mood Recognizer using Facial Expressions` - **Music Player**
* `Drowsiness Detection` - **Alarm Notification!**
---
## Part 1 : Stay **_Alert_** When You Drive!

---
## How to resolve **_Drowsiness Detection_**?
* Capture facial landmarks and features using library functions in python
* Mathematically estimate the Eye Aspect Ratio in real time frames
* Monitor the variation in EAR over a select number of frames and buzz the alarm when set condition is met
---
## Part 2 : We Analyse Your **_Expressions_** & Auto-Generate `Mood Based Music`!

## How **_Drive AI_** detects _mood based on expression_ to play music :
* Train a dataset of human faces that depict 6 classes of expressions
* Gather fine and broad features using CNN archicture based on ResNet50
* Based on predicted class, fetch music from database and play it
---
## Part 3 : Be Aware Of `Objects In Surroundings`, Track In Real Time

## How to _estimate distance_ and _classify_ objects ?
* Using a combination of regression and classification to create bounding boxes + labels
* Tiny Yolo model is trained on a large dataset to accomplish this task
* Pinhole Camera Principle helps in estimating distance through triangular similarity
---
## Why is **_Drive AI_** an essential tool for a vehicle in 2019?
* A simplified yet optimal safety tool that utilises `fast ML/AI algorithms`
* Requires `no explicit interaction` from user end
* Mood based music player `improves overall UX` and adds to the functionality

## **`Drive AI`** provides a 3 fold AI facility for your vehicle
* `Distance Estimation & Classification` - **Back Camera Object Detection**
* `Mood Recognizer using Facial Expressions` - **Music Player**
* `Drowsiness Detection` - **Alarm Notification!**
---
## Part 1 : Stay **`Alert`** When You Drive!

---
## How to resolve **_Drowsiness Detection_**?
* Capture **facial landmarks** and **features**
* Mathematically estimate the **Eye Aspect Ratio** in **real time** frames
* Monitor the **variation in EAR** over a select number of frames and **buzz the alarm** when set condition is met

## How **`Drive AI`** detects _mood based on expression_ to play music :
* Train a **dataset of human faces** that depict **6** classes of **expressions**
* Gather fine and broad features using **CNN archicture** inspired by **ResNet50 Architecture**
* Based on predicted class, fetch **music from database** and **play** it
---
## Part 3 : Be Aware Of `Objects In Surroundings`, Track and **Estimate Distance** In Real Time

---
## How to **_estimate distance_** and **_classify objects_** ?
* Using a combination of **regression and classification** to create **bounding boxes + labels**
* **YOLO-tiny model** is **trained** on a dataset to accomplish this task
* **Pinhole Camera Principle** helps in **estimating distance** through **triangular similarity**

## Why is **`Drive AI`** an essential tool for vehicles in 2019?
* A **simplified** yet **optimal safety** tool that utilises **`fast ML/AI algorithms`**
* Requires **`no explicit interaction`** from user end
* Mood based music player **`improves overall UX`** and adds to the functionality
